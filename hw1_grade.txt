3/3. We both got different answers for question 1.

comments on style

The style was similiar to my own but I was unaware of how Travis used the pow(b,2) on line 23 and 26.
The comments helped with explaining the variables.
Wrote out the long way to question 2, but still resulting in the correct answer. 
Not too much white space, but still easy to follow with no confusion.
